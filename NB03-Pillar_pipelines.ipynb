      "\n",
      "### Criterion 1: Strategic Direction for Decarbonisation\n",
      "**Result:** YES\n",
      "**Reasoning:** The UK has set a strategic direction for decarbonisation through its 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 81% compared to 1990 levels, which aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Criterion 2: Enshrined in Law\n",
      "**Result:** YES\n",
      "**Reasoning:** The Climate Change Act 2008, as amended in 2019, commits the UK to 'net zero' by 2050 and makes long-term emissions reduction targets legally binding, indicating that the strategic direction is enshrined in law.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Criterion 3: Sets Out Obligations\n",
      "**Result:** YES\n",
      "**Reasoning:** The Climate Change Act 2008 mandates the UK government to set legally binding carbon budgets, which cap the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over a five-year period, ensuring progress towards the 2050 net zero target. This satisfies the obligation of developing, revising, implementing, or complying with domestic plans, strategies, or policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Criterion 4: Exceptional Case\n",
      "**Result:** YES\n",
      "**Reasoning:** Although the primary framework climate law is the Climate Change Act 2008, the combination of the broad Environment Act 2021 and the clearly linked executive Net Zero Strategy could be considered an exceptional case. However, given that the Climate Change Act 2008 already satisfies criteria 1, 2, and 3, this criterion is not necessary for the overall assessment.\n",

The UK has a clear strategic direction for decarbonisation (Criterion 1), it is enshrined in law through the Climate Change Act 2008 (Criterion 2), and it sets out obligations such as meeting national targets and developing carbon budgets (Criterion 3).\n",

    "# CP1b - Does the country’s framework climate law specify key accountability elements?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A country is assessed as ‘Yes’ if its framework climate law contains all three of the following accountability elements: \n",
    "1. Specification of who is accountable to whom for at least one stated obligation (e.g. accountability of executive to parliament, or private parties to executive authorities) \n",
    "2. Specification of how compliance is assessed for at least one stated obligation (e.g. transparency mechanisms in the form of monitoring, reporting and verification, parliamentary oversight, expert assessments, court proceedings) \n",
    "3. Specification of what happens in the case of non-compliance for at least one stated obligation (e.g. parliamentary intervention, judicial orders, financial penalties). \n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the accountability processes outlined these are examples of the types of relationships that usually qualify for the sub-questions. Each sub-question must be satisfied by at least one of the types of accountability.\n",
    "1. Who is accountable to whom?\n",
    "Examples of key relationships include:\n",
    "a.\texecutive to parliament \n",
    "b.\texecutive to executive and/or administrative agencies \n",
    "c.\tnational to sub-national and sub-national to national\n",
    "d.\texecutive to judiciary\n",
    "e.\texecutive to expert bodies\n",
    "f.\texecutive to citizens \n",
    "g.\tprivate parties to citizens \n",
    "h.\tprivate parties to executive authorities.\n",
    "2. How is compliance assessed?\n",
    "Some of the most common ways of assessing compliance are:\n",
    "a.\ttransparency mechanisms in the form of monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV). Although this type of mechanism does not specify a decision-maker responsible for assessing whether an obligation has been met, this type of process is crucial for ensuring that there is political accountability for the implementation of climate law\n",
    "b.\tparliamentary oversight, which can also be used to assess the effectiveness of the legislation in achieving the stated aims\n",
    "c.\tExpert assessment\n",
    "d.\tCourt proceedings\n",
    "e.\tAlternative Dispute Resolution.\n",
    "3. What happens in the case of non-compliance?\n",
    "It is relatively rare for countries to specify what happens in the case of non-compliance. Relevant practices identified in the laws can be grouped under certain categories. Some examples are:\n",
    "a.\tParliamentary intervention\n",
    "b.\tGovernmental or ministerial intervention\n",
    "c.\tJudicial orders\n",
    "d.\tOrders and fines by regulators\n",
    "e.\tCourt imposed financial penalties\n",
    "f.\tRegulatory financial penalties\n",
    "g.\tMulti-stakeholder agreements.\n",
    "Note that if a country has multiple laws assessed under the previous indicator, all are considered under this indicator on whether they together contain the three accountability elements above."
