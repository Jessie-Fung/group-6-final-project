Additionally, the document mentions that the country aims to \"fulfill the reporting requirements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement\" (page not specified, doc Albania’s National Adaptation Plan First - progress report). This suggests that the country has a strategic direction for decarbonisation aligned with the Paris Agreement.\\n\\n### Criterion 2: Enshrined in Law\\n**Result:** YES\\n**Reasoning:** The National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft mentions a \"Law for Climate Change\" (page not specified, doc National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft), indicating that climate change is addressed through legislative means.\\n\\n### Criterion 3: Sets Out Obligations\\n**Result:** YES\\n**Reasoning:** The National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft outlines various obligations, including \"monitoring the execution of agreed measures\" (page not specified, doc Albania’s National Adaptation Plan First - progress report) and \"ensured alignment with EU climate change Acquis and fulfilment of the UNFCCC requirements through introduction of a mechanism for monitoring and reporting GHG emissions and other information relevant to climate change on regular basis\" (page not specified, doc National Energy and Climate Plan 2019 Draft). This suggests that the country has set out obligations related to climate change.\\n\\n### Criterion 4: Exceptional Case\\n**Result:** NO\\n**Reasoning:** Although the country has a broad environmental law and a climate strategy, the information provided does not suggest that these two elements are sufficient to meet the exceptional case criterion.\\n\\n## Final Assessment\\n\\n**Overall Result:** YES\\n\\n**Logic Applied:** Criteria 1, 2, and 3 are all satisfied, indicating that the country has a framework climate law.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Based on the provided context, Albania has a framework climate law that sets a strategic direction for decarbonisation, is enshrined in law, and sets out obligations related to climate change.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 502, 'prompt_tokens': 3491, 'total_tokens': 3993, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_name': 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-0c0f675fb4a04ca58d0ad22b4e124110', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--c1a7048d-5264-4bb3-bc28-b9b317dba17f-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3491, 'output_tokens': 502, 'total_tokens': 3993, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}})"

    "2. Specification of how compliance is assessed for at least one stated obligation (e.g. transparency mechanisms in the form of monitoring, reporting and verification, parliamentary oversight, expert assessments, court proceedings) \n",
    "3. Specification of what happens in the case of non-compliance for at least one stated obligation (e.g. parliamentary intervention, judicial orders, financial penalties). \n",
    "\n",
    "Like with CP1a, these are evaluated separately and then evaluted together by a evaluator LLM. There is additional guidance in the methodology on how to asses these criteria wich is included in the prompts (see `scripts/climate_policy_pipeline/cp1/prompts`)\n",
